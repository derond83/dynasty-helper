# Dynasty Helper

Waiver-wire and roster advice for Sleeper **dynasty** leagues, football and basketball, in one app:
`https://derond83.github.io/dynasty-helper/`

- **Football** offense is valued by [KeepTradeCut](https://keeptradecut.com/dynasty-rankings) or
  [Dynasty Daddy](https://dynasty-daddy.com/) in the league's own format (1QB or superflex, KTC's TE-premium level).
  IDP, when the league has it, is valued by a production model scored with the league's settings and cross-checked
  against the free FantasyPros dynasty DL / LB / DB rankings.
- **Basketball** uses the [Hashtag Basketball dynasty rankings](https://hashtagbasketball.com/fantasy-basketball-dynasty-rankings),
  weighted toward the positions (G / F / C) where you're thin, plus a rookie-draft board while a rookie draft is pending.

## Using it

- **League tabs** across the top switch leagues. Each league has its own address (`#/<league id>/<tab>`), so links,
  bookmarks and the back button work. Inside a league: **Team** (positional balance, then your roster and the wire
  in one list), **League** (league value table and how it works), **Moves** (waiver moves), **Trades** (trade ideas),
  **Draft** (the rookie-draft board, while a rookies-only draft is pending) or **Matchup** (this week's matchup, during
  the season; the two take turns) and **Settings**.
- **Settings** (per league, saved in this browser): your team, offensive values source (football), how waiver moves
  and trades are judged, trade values source (basketball), and your locked players.
- **Leagues page** (top right, or **＋ Add league**):
  - *Your Sleeper account*: enter your username once. Every league then opens on your team, your leagues are listed
    for one-click adding, and leagues are followed when Sleeper starts a new season (a dynasty league gets a new id
    each season).
  - *Add by league ID*: any Sleeper league that is **dynasty** and **football or basketball**. Redraft, keeper and
    guillotine leagues, and other sports, are refused with the reason.
- The two built-in leagues (`leagues.json`) get a daily snapshot, so they open even if Sleeper can't be reached.
  Leagues you add load live from Sleeper.

## Hosting (GitHub Pages)

`.github/workflows/refresh.yml`:

- runs twice a day, at 10:17 and 16:17 UTC (and on demand from **Actions → Refresh data and deploy → Run workflow**),
- runs `refresh_data.py` for both sports and commits the new data if it changed,
- runs the smoke tests, then deploys to GitHub Pages. Every push to `main` deploys too.

Each source is fetched on its own. If one breaks (say KeepTradeCut changes its page), the others still refresh, the
broken one keeps its last good data, the league page shows a warning, and the run is marked failed so GitHub emails
you. If KeepTradeCut itself can't be read, its values come from Dynasty Daddy's copy of KTC instead.

## Run locally

```sh
python3 refresh_data.py          # both sports + built-in league snapshots (or --sport nfl / --sport nba)
python3 -m http.server 8000      # then open http://localhost:8000/
node tests/smoke.js
```

## How football suggestions are made

**Format.** Superflex when the league has a SUPER_FLEX slot or two QB slots. TE premium follows KeepTradeCut's guidance:
TE+ for a 0.5–1 point TE reception bonus, TE++ for 2 TE slots or a bonus over 1, TE+++ for 2 TE slots and a bonus.
Dynasty Daddy has no TE-premium values, so its standard values are used (the page says so).

**Offensive value** is the source's dynasty value; the *win now* setting blends in its redraft value.

**IDP value**, in roughly points per game (IDP leagues only):

1. Score each season with the league's IDP settings.
2. Count only part of a player's own big plays (INT, forced fumble, recovery, TD, safety, blocked kick; 35% by default);
   the rest is the position average for his snaps, so tackles and sacks drive value.
3. Weight seasons 3 : 1.5 : 0.6 (this season, last, two ago), per game played.
4. Average with per-snap production projected at the snaps he's playing now (catches role changes).
5. Shrink small samples toward a replacement-level player at his position.
6. Discount for age (production assumed to end around 33 for DL, 32 for LB/DB; six or more years left counts fully).
7. Add 5% for DL/LB or LB/DB eligibility.
8. Blend 30% with FantasyPros: their #k player at a position is worth what the model's #k player is worth.

Next to each IDP value is points per game above a waiver-level player at his position.

**Moves**, planned one at a time:

- Each position keeps its dedicated starting slots plus one (superflex counts toward QB; dual-eligible players count
  for both). Moves that fix a shortfall come first.
- Offense and IDP are managed separately: a set number of active spots are IDP (IDP starters + 2 by default, in
  Tuning), the rest offense, and a move only crosses sides to restore that split.
- Otherwise a swap stays on one side and must add 12% or more value, and at least 150 offensive value or 0.5 IDP points per game.
- Kickers and team defenses aren't valued; they're left out of lineups and never suggested.
- Taxi and IR players are never dropped, and neither is any player you **lock**. Injured free agents (IR, PUP,
  suspended) stay on the wire but aren't suggested.

## How basketball suggestions are made

- **Value.** Dynasty rank becomes a 0–100 value: `100 · e^(−(rank−1)/110)`. Unranked players are 0.
- **Positional need.** For G, F and C: your top starters' value compared with the league average, plus depth against
  a target of two per starting slot.
- **Fit.** `value × (1 + 0.6 × need)` at the player's neediest position.
- **Drops.** Your lowest-value active player whose loss keeps every position at starter depth. A swap must add about
  12% value. IR players and locked players are never dropped.
- **Rookie draft.** While a rookies-only draft is pending, rookies are shown on a draft board instead of the waiver wire.

## How trade ideas are made (both sports)

Every 1-for-1, 2-for-1 and 1-for-2 swap with each other team is checked (your locked, taxi and IR players are never
offered). A trade is suggested only if all of these hold:

1. **Fair on market value**, within the trade-fairness setting (10% by default) in both directions. The best player in
   an uneven deal carries a premium (values are compared raised to the power 1.35), as trade calculators do. A player a
   side would have to release to make room counts against that side.
2. **It fills their need**: their starters improve, at a position where they're thin.
3. **It gives you something concrete**: your starters improve (your first backup at each position counts at 35%), or
   you gain clearly more value (10% by default, the "Value-only trades" setting, and at least 400).
4. **It keeps your roster in shape**: it won't leave a position below the depth you aim for by thinning it further,
   or add to a position you've already filled unless the newcomer would start. A non-starter beyond your target at
   his position counts at half value to you, so a fourth QB in a one-QB league isn't a "value win", and trading
   surplus away costs you less. Each card shows how your position counts change.

Ideas are ranked by your gain, nudged toward deals the other team will like more; at most two per partner, and the
same player of yours appears in at most two.

- **Football**: offense only, on KeepTradeCut or Dynasty Daddy value in the league's format. IDP has no trade market,
  and draft picks aren't valued yet.
- **Basketball**: on a 0–10,000 market-style scale. By default the average of Hashtag Basketball's crowdsourced
  [keeper values](https://hashtagbasketball.com/keeper) (vote ratings: `10,000 · ((rating − 1,000) / (top − 1,000))^1.2`)
  and its curated dynasty rank (`10,000 · e^(−(rank − 1)/45)`); Settings can switch to either one alone.

## How the Matchup tab works (both sports)

Sleeper's projected stats for the week are scored with the league's own settings (so IDP, kickers, team defenses and
basketball categories count exactly as the league scores them). Out, IR and suspended players count 0, Doubtful 25%,
Questionable 85%; football players on bye count 0. A basketball player's week is the sum of his games.

- **Optimal / Current** toggle (remembered per league): the scoreboard and lineup table show either each team's best
  lineup by projection (exact search over the league's slots) or the lineups set in Sleeper right now.
- **Lineup table**: slot by slot against this week's opponent (from Sleeper's matchups), then every active bench player
  on both sides as **BN** rows, by projection. Your players are tagged **Start** (in your best lineup but not set) or
  **Sit** (set but not in your best lineup).
- **Win chance**: the difference in totals of the lineups shown against their combined spread (each player's weekly
  spread grows with his projection).
- **Lineup changes**: "Start X over Y (+points)" against the lineup set in Sleeper.
- **Before kickoff** (basketball: before games lock): your questionable or doubtful starters, and toss-ups between a
  starter and a bench player within a point.

Projections are refreshed twice a day (6 AM and noon Eastern).

## Ideas for later

- Draft pick values in the league value table.
- Rookie and taxi planning for the offseason in football.
